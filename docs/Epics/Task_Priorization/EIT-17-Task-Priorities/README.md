# EIT-17 Task Prioritization

## Summary
As a user managing multiple tasks, I want to assign priorities (low, medium, high) to tasks so that I can focus on completing the most important tasks first.

## User Story
- **Title**: Task Prioritization
- **Epic**: Task Prioritization
- **Description**: Allows users to assign a priority level to each task, helping them organize tasks by importance and manage their workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** I am a logged-in user on the task dashboard page
- **When** I edit a task and assign a priority
- **Or When** I assign a priority at task creation
- **Then** the task should have a priority and be displayed accordingly.

## Implementation Details
The task creation and edit forms include options for setting priority as low, medium, or high. This priority level is displayed on each task card, allowing users to quickly see the importance level of each task.
