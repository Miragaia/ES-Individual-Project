# EIT-15 Filter Tasks by Category

## Summary
As a user managing tasks, I want to filter tasks by category so that I can view tasks that belong to specific groups or subjects.

## User Story
- **Title**: Filter Tasks by Category
- **Epic**: Sorting and Filtering
- **Description**: Allows users to filter tasks by category, helping them to view tasks in a structural way.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** I am a logged-in user on the task dashboard page
- **When** I select the type of Category to filter (previously created)
- **Then** the tasks should be displayed accordingly to the filtering.

## Implementation Details
The Category should be previously created.
The task filtering will be later applied together with all the other filters in the same endpoint.
