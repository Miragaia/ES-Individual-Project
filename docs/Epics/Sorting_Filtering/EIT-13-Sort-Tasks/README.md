# EIT-13 Sort Taks

## Summary
As a user with multiple tasks , I want to sort tasks by creation date or deadline so that I can view my tasks in a prioritized order based on their timeline.

## User Story
- **Title**: Sort Tasks
- **Epic**: Sorting and Filtering
- **Description**: Allows users to sort taks by creation date or deadline, helping them to view tasks in a prioritized way.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** I am a logged-in user on the task dashboard page
- **When** I select the type of sorting  (creation date/deadline)
- **Then** the task should be displayed accordingly to the sorting.

## Implementation Details
The task sorting will be later applied together with all the other filters in the same endpoint.
