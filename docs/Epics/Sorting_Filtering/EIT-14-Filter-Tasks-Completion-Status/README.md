# EIT-14 Filter Tasks by Completion Status

## Summary
As a user managing tasks, I want to filter tasks by completion status so that I can focus on tasks that are either completed or still pending (TO DO, IN PROGRESS).

## User Story
- **Title**: Filter Tasks by Completion Status
- **Epic**: Sorting and Filtering
- **Description**: Allows users to filter tasks by completion status, helping them to view tasks in a prioritized way.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** I am a logged-in user on the task dashboard page
- **When** I select the type of completion status to filter (TO DO/ IN PROGRESS/ COMPLETED)
- **Then** the tasks should be displayed accordingly to the filtering. 

## Implementation Details
The task filtering will be later applied together with all the other filters in the same endpoint.
