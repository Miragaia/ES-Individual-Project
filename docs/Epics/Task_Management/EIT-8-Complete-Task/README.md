# EIT-8 Complete Task

## Summary
As a user managing tasks, I want to mark tasks as completed so that I can track which tasks are finished.

## User Story
- **Title**: Complete Task
- **Epic**: Task Management
- **Description**: Allows users to mark tasks as completed to differentiate between pending and finished tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** I am a logged-in user on the task dashboard page
- **When** I click to complete a task
- **Then** the task should be displayed as completed.

## Implementation Details
Users can mark tasks as completed by selecting the "Complete" option for any task. This updates the task status in the database, and the task list displays the task as completed, often with a visual indicator (e.g., strikethrough or a check mark).
